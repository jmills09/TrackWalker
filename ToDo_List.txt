Need:
Create Loss Dynamic During Trainin
Feed in Convolutional Net Features
Pulling Train Data and Validation Data dynamically rather than all at once in the beginning
Accuracy By Particle

Dump Training PARAMS into txt file in the tensorboard folder w/ custom string

Want:
Size of Accuracy Threshold search area adjustable by hyperparam
Length of Proposed Step
Length of Truth Step
Make some Event Display Images
Hyperparam Dict into a global variable
Feed Network the current length of track as input

Done:
Try L2 Weighting for Loss
Instead of Track End Class Make center pixel the 'track end'
Instead of Track End Prediction, use separate head to predict end of tracks
Accuracy of just placing Endstep
Accuracy of placing non-end steps
Doing Validation Set
Add 10dist Accuracy Threshold search area
Move Model to Own File ModelFunctions.py
Change Hyperparams to a dictionary
Load and format data function to DataLoader.py
